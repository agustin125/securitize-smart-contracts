This project implements a marketplace smart contract where users can:

List ERC-20 tokens for sale at a specified price in Ether.

Purchase listed tokens by sending the required Ether.

Withdraw their Ether earnings from the marketplace.

Interact with the marketplace using EIP-712 signed messages for token transfers and pre-authorized listings.

The project uses the Hardhat framework for development, testing, and deployment.
